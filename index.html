<h1>&#9900; Welcome to Konya ! Konya is a province of Turkey. Konya is the largest city of Turkey. &#9900;</h1>
<h3>&#9900; Konya is a major city in south-western edge of the Central Anatolian Plateau and is the seventh-most-populous city in Turkey with a metropolitan population of over 2.1 million. Konya is an economically and industrially developed city and the capital of Konya Province. After its conquest by Turkish tribes, Konya became the capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum (Anatolia) (1077–1308) and the Karamanids (13th century–1487). </h3>
<h2>Name</h2>
<h3>&#9900; Konya, was known in classical antiquity and during the medieval period as Ἰκόνιον (Ikónion) in Greek (with regular Medieval Greek apheresis Kónio(n)) and as Iconium in Latin. This name is commonly explained as a derivation from εἰκών (icon), as an ancient Greek legend ascribed its name to the "eikon" (image), or the "gorgon's (Medusa's) head", with which Perseus vanquished the native population before founding the city. In some historic English texts, the city's name appears as Konia or Koniah.</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>&#9900; Excavations have shown that the region was inhabited during the Late Copper Age, around 3000 BC. The city came under the influence of the Hittites around 1500 BC. Later it was overtaken by the Sea Peoples in around 1200 BC.

The Phrygians established their kingdom in central Anatolia in the 8th century BC. Xenophon describes Iconium, as the city was called, as the last city of Phrygia. The region was overwhelmed by Cimmerian invaders c. 690 BC. It was later part of the Persian Empire, until Darius III was defeated by Alexander the Great in 333 BC. Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death and the town came under the rule of Seleucus I Nicator. During the Hellenistic period the town was ruled by the kings of Pergamon. As Attalus III, the last king of Pergamon, was about to die without an heir, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Republic. Once incorporated into the Roman Empire, under the rule of emperor Claudius, the city's name was changed to Claudioconium, and during the rule of emperor Hadrianus to Colonia Aelia Hadriana.</h3>
<h2>Government<h2>
<h3 style="color:white;">&#9900; The first local administration in Konya was founded in 1830. This administration was converted into a municipality in 1876. In March 1989, the municipality became a Metropolitan Municipality. As of that date, Konya had three central district municipalities (Meram, Selçuklu, Karatay) and a Metropolitan Municipality.<h3>
<h2 style="color:white;">Geography<h2>
<h3 style="color:white;">&#9900;Konya is the center of the largest province, the largest plain (Konya Plain) and is among the largest cities in the country. It is the seventh most populated city in Turkey.

Konya City is in the southern part of the Central Anatolia Region. The land is broad and flat with a lot of lowlands and plateaus. The plateaus are covered with rich steppes, therefore, affecting the agriculture sector. Additionally, the southernmost part of Konya is largely surrounded by the Taurus Mountains.<h3>
